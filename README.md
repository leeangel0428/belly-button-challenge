# Introduction
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 14 aka the belly-button-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 14's challenge on JavaScript. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview
Description: "In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare."

There were 6 parts to the assignment:

1) Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
2) Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. See reference image:

3) Create a bubble chart that displays each sample. See reference image:

4) Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5) Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page. See reference image:

6) Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.

# Additional Information:
In this repository, you will find the Starter_Code folder that contains the index.html, samples.json dataset, and the static folder that contains my finished code in the app.js file. I cannot take full credit for this assignment as I relied heavily on the github repositories of two other people to get me started. There are many similarities but I tried my best to make the code my own. Aside from the sources cited below, everything used was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.

# Troubleshooting:
The only notable error to mention is that because I did not do the bonus/advanced portion of the challenge, I have an error on my console. The image shows what it looked like before I even made any changes to my app.js file but it pretty much looks the same. Please see image.
